# Phase 3 Architecture Analysis

## Current State
- **Legacy Architecture** (src/scraping/): 366-line BaseScraper with complex retry logic
- **Modern Architecture** (src/scrapers/): Cleaner separation with PlaywrightBaseScraper
- **Data Models**: Basic @dataclass definitions for BookInfo and ScrapingResult

## Type Safety Issues Identified
1. Missing type hints on most methods
2. No return type annotations
3. Generic types not used for collections (List, Dict, Optional)
4. No Protocol/ABC definitions for interfaces
5. Exception handling not typed

## Unification Strategy
1. Create Protocol interfaces for scraper contracts
2. Build unified AsyncBaseScraper with comprehensive type hints
3. Enhanced data models with Pydantic validation
4. Proper generic typing throughout
5. Typed exception hierarchy
